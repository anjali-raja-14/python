"""
Python packages organize and structure code into reusable components, similar to organizing games by genre in folders. Creating a package involves creating a directory, adding modules, and including an __init__.py file. Subpackages can be created similarly. To distribute a package, a setup.py file using setuptools is required. The text also discusses various Python frameworks for web development and essential Python packages for AI, machine learning, data visualization, NLP, deep learning, and GUI development.
